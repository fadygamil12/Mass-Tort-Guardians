      <h3 class="fw-bolder text-light">AFFF</h3>
      <p class="text-light">The firefighting foam, officially termed Aqueous Film-Forming Foam (AFFF), has become a subject of increasing legal disputes. Employed widely since the 1960s, particularly by the military and airports, this foam is renowned for its effectiveness in quelling fires fed by jet fuel and petroleum. The primary component of AFFF, per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), is currently under heightened scrutiny due to concerns about its potential carcinogenic properties.</p>
