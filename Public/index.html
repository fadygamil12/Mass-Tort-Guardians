            <p>
              <span class="fw-bold under question">1. How do you acquire Mass Tort Leads with Signed Retainers?</span><br>

              <span class="fw-bold">-Step 1:</span> Initiate advertising on platforms like Google, Bing, Facebook, television, and radio.<br>
              <span class="fw-bold">-Step 2:</span> Our call center engages with potential leads, ensuring they meet your eligibility criteria through verification. <br>
              <span class="fw-bold">-Step 3:</span> If qualified, the claimant signs your retainer and completes HIPAA documentation via Docusign. <br>
              </p>
              <p>
              <span class="fw-bold under question">2. Are the retainers you provide exclusive?</span><br>
              Yes, the high-quality case leads we provide are 100% exclusive to you and/or your law firm. <br>
              </p>
              <p>
              <span class="fw-bold under question">3. Can I have leads qualified before receiving them?</span><br>
              Yes, through our signed retainer program, we not only generate mass tort leads but also qualify and sign them to your firm's unique retainer.
              </p>
              <p>
              <span class="fw-bold under question">4. How does the signed retainer process work?</span><br>
              We offer signed retainers at a fixed price, minimizing risk in mass tort marketing. Each claimant receives a comprehensive packet, including an intake questionnaire, your signed retainer, signed HIPAA, and signed HITECH documents, all guaranteed to meet your criteria.
              </p>
              <p>
              <span class="fw-bold under question">5. What are your primary practice areas?</span><br>
              We cover all major law areas consumers search for, with popular focuses on mass tort leads with signed retainers, motor vehicle accident (MVA) with injury leads, DUI and DWI leads, and personal injury leads.
             </p>
              <p>
                <span class="fw-bold under question">6. Can I purchase leads within specific practice areas?</span><br>
                Certainly! You can select one or multiple practice areas. Customizable filters/fields are available, tailored to increase your intake of legal prospects within your specific area of practice.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="fw-bold under question">7. Do you have minimum monthly requirements?</span><br>
              While fixed monthly minimums aren't in place, we seek partnerships with firms looking to grow and capable of handling a significant number of calls.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="fw-bold under question">8. What is the cost?</span><br>
              Costs depend on case volume, practice area, and coverage area. Contact us to discuss your specifics for a tailored pricing estimate.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="fw-bold under question">9. Are cases delivered in real time?</span><br>It varies. Live phone calls are delivered in real-time, while signed retainers undergo a meticulous quality control process before reaching attorneys. 
              </p>
