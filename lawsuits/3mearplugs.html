      <h3 class="fw-bolder text-light">3M Earplugs</h3>
      <p class="text-light">Numerous military service members and veterans have filed lawsuits against 3M, alleging that the company's earplugs were faulty and resulted in hearing damage due to exposure to loud sounds during military activities. On August 29, 2023, 3M agreed to a $6.01 billion settlement to resolve these lawsuits, as confirmed by both the company and the plaintiffs' attorneys.
        The focus of the case revolved around the Combat Arms earplugs, utilized by the U.S. military in training and combat between 2003 and 2015, including deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq. Lawsuit plaintiffs asserted that 3M concealed design flaws, manipulated test results, and neglected to provide proper usage instructions for the earplugs, resulting in hearing damage.</p>
